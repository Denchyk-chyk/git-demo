Sword and spear
Wall of shields

There's no need
In retreat

Strong will stand
On their holy land

Those who fear
Will disappear

[guitar solo]

So let it be written
So let it b done
They'll never be bitten
They are second to none

[keyboard solo]

Birth of terror, death of much more
I'm the slave of fear, my captor
