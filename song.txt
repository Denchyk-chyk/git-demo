Sword and spear
Wall of shields

There's no need
In retreat

Strong will stand
On their holy land

Those who fear
Will disappear

Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy, everyone's after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling

[guitar solo]

So let it be written
So let it b done
They'll never be bitten
They are second to none

[keyboard solo]

Birth of terror, death of much more
I'm the slave of fear, my captor
